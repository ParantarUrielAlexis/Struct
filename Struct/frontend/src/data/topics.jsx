          <p>
            Arrays are data structures that store multiple values under a single
            variable name. Each value is called an element, and elements are
            accessed using their index, starting from 0.

        title: "Understanding Indexing",
        content: (
          <p>
            Indexing is the process of accessing elements in an array using
            their position. Array indices start at 0, meaning the first element
            is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
          </p>

        title: "Accessing Elements",
        content: (
          <p>
            To access an element, use square brackets with the index. For
            example: <code>arr[2]</code> retrieves the third element of the
            array.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        title: "Modifying Elements",
        content: (
          <p>
            You can modify an element by assigning a new value to its index. For
            example: <code>arr[2] = 10</code> changes the third element to 10.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        title: "Out of Bounds Indexing",
        content: (
          <p>
            Accessing an index outside the array's bounds (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>arr[10]</code> when the array has only 5 elements) will result
            in an error or undefined behavior.
