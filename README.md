<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**Sruct Academy** is a gamified web platform designed to make learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) engaging, visual, and interactive. Through mini-games and lessons, learners can grasp DSA concepts while having fun and tracking their progress.

### Why Struct Academy?

- **Gamified Learning**: Reinforce DSA concepts through levels, challenges, and interactive visualizations.
- **Designed for Beginners**: Tailored for students new to coding and problem-solving.
- **Curriculum-Driven**: Aligned with core academic data structures and algorithms topics commonly taught in universities.
- **Play While You Learn**: Encourages engagement by blending education with hands-on games.
- **Minimal Distractions**: No AI or leaderboard mechanics—focused solely on learning and mastering concepts at your own pace.
- **Feedback Through Gameplay**: Mistakes are learning opportunities, visualized through interactive errors and hints.
- **Encourages Mastery**: Replay levels to improve understanding rather than compete for scores.
